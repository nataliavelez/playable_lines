# Playable lines experiment

This repository contains the code to create a playable multiplayer (currently up to 8 players) experiment investigating the role of universalization in norm formation/learning and moral judgement, based of the previous work of [Kwon et al. (2023)](https://ztangent.github.io/assets/pdf/2023-universalization-rule-breaking.pdf).

The experiment is implemented using [Empirica](https://docs.empirica.ly/), with the 2D gridworld game being implemented in [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) (with the support of [Grid-Engine](https://annoraaq.github.io/grid-engine/)).

A current (playable) version of the game can be found (here)[https://www.experiment.joshuapwhite.com/].
